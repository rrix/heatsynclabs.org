## Arduino Uno: $40

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the [Arduino programming language](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) (based on [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/)) and the Arduino development environment (based on [Processing](http://www.processing.org/)). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).

## Pebble Kit: $35


[![](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pebble-assembled-top_small.jpg)](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/pebble-assembled-top_small/)Great kit for beginner to intermediate soldering. The Pebble is an Arduino shield that provides you with some interesting, common I/O devices, such as a temperature sensor, LDR, potentiometer, pushbuttons and a space for an LCD display (LCD sold separately), all nicely integrated onto a PCB, to easily let you get started experimenting with Arduino programs. See the [HeatSync Labs Wiki article on the Pebble](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Pebble) for more info. **Does not include LCD screen, sold separately below.**

See the [HeatSync Labs Wiki article on the Pebble](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Pebble) for more info including a Bill of Materials.** **

## LCD (compatible with Pebble): $16

## Simon Kit: $30


[![](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110129_030451_small.jpg)](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/img_20110129_030451_small/)Great kit for beginners to assemble and learn soldering, with all through-hole components (instead of tricky surface-mount stuff.) When you're done you get a playable "Simon Says" game that lights up and makes sound, plus the kit is actually an Arduino so you can buy a USB FTDI adapter and reprogram it using the Arduino program as if it were a "Lilypad Arduino w/ ATmega328."

## USB FTDI Adapter: $20


![](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ftdi-small.jpg)

Allows you to connect to an Arduino or similar microcontroller via USB, when the Arduino doesn't have its own USB port (i.e. the Simon kit and other Arduino clones.)

Requires a USB Mini-B cable not included.
