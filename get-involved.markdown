**Come to the lab:**

Hackerspaces are PLACES. Come meet us! We're open to the public **M-F 7pm-10pm** (and often outside these hours) for FREE! Bring your projects and your passion -- I promise we won't bite. Or come out for something specific, check out our calendar on our [events page](/events).

**Talk to us online:**

****At [groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs](http://groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs) our ~300 members discuss their projects every day. Ask your questions or propose your own projects here! For best results, [ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro).

**Watch us LIVE :**

****Point your browser to [live.heatsynclabs.org](http://live.heatsynclabs.org) and see what is going on in the lab RIGHT NOW!

**Call the Lab Phone: **

****_Calling (480) 751-1929 may yield unexpected results depending on who's in the lab! Please limit your call time as it is billed by the minute._

**Edit the Wiki:**

****See what members are working on and find information about tools and processes in the space at the [heatsynclabs.org/wiki](http://heatsynclabs.org/wiki)

**Chat on IRC:**

****Finally, if you know what IRC is then you know what [irc.freenode.net#heatsynclabs](irc://irc.freenode.net#heatsynclabs) means.
