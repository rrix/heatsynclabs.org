HeatSync Labs is lead by a Board of Directors, which rules HeatSync Labs with an iron fist and a golden wallet.  Each officer is voted into office once a year by the membership, unless they become vampires and become impeached.  The <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Bylaws" target="_blank">bylaws</a> outline the structure of the Board in more detail.

<strong>Please direct most questions to our community by emailing heatsynclabs [at] googlegroups.com</strong> -- we are a grassroots organization and all but the most critical of decisions are made by the community. If you must get in contact with the entire board, however, you may email board [at] heatsynclabs.org.

Our current slate of officers are the following:
<h2><strong>Champions</strong></h2>
<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-393" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Jeremy" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/jeremy_bio1.jpg" alt="Jeremy" width="200" height="200" />Jeremy Leung</strong>

Originally from Deutschland, Jeremy immediately fell in love with the American hacker community and is driven to promote the positive connotations of the word "hacker".  After graduating from UAT and stepping down from leadership of DC480, to join the work force, he still had the lingering idea of wanting to make a mad scientists lab with his friends.  During the day he works as a Trainer of Systems Technicians, Administrators and Engineers.  At night he dons the appropriate safety gear to create things and push HeatSync Labs forward.

<h2><strong>Treasurer</strong></h2>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-774" style="margin: 10px;" title="Jose" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/jose_bio.jpg" alt="Jose" width="200" height="200" /><strong>Jose Diaz</strong>
jose [at] heatsynclabs.org

Jose Diaz is just a plain old professional developer and technology addict like many of the patrons of HeatSync Labs. He enjoys coding, online gaming, and hardware hacking--particularly on the Arduino platform, which led to his role in helping foster the local Phoenix Arduino hacker community. By day, he develops web apps to bring home the bacon and while not managing the treasures of the HeatSync Labs treasury, he loves spending quality time with his family.

<h2><strong>Operations</strong></h2>
<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-415" style="margin: 10px;" title="Will" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/will_bio.jpg" alt="Will" width="200" height="200" />Will Bradley</strong>
will [at] heatsynclabs.org

Hailing from the exotic Kingdom of Hawaii, Will is an IT Manager, System Administrator, and code monkey with an interest in security and practicality.  He's lost count of how many servers under his dominion, and can be seen playing with SQL injection, lockpicking, ARP spoofing, and WEP cracking, as well as exploring electronics, microcontrollers, and Ruby on Rails. Hobbies include video production, photography, gaming, snowboarding, and trolling. He's also probably the guy to yell at if something computer-related goes wrong.
<h2><strong>Secretary</strong></h2>
