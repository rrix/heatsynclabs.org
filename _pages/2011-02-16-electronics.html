Attend a workshop or class and want to get the tools to go with it? Get it straight from the lab!
<h2>Arduino Uno: $40</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1161 alignright" title="arduino-uno" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/arduino-uno.gif" alt="" width="180" height="149" />

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino programming language</a> (based on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a>) and the Arduino development environment (based on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).

<h2>Pebble Kit: $35</h2>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1270" href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/pebble-assembled-top_small/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1270" title="Pebble-assembled-top_small" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pebble-assembled-top_small.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="156" /></a>Great kit for beginner to intermediate soldering. The Pebble is an Arduino shield that provides you with some interesting, common I/O devices, such as a temperature sensor, LDR, potentiometer, pushbuttons and a space for an LCD display (LCD sold separately), all nicely integrated onto a PCB, to easily let you get started experimenting with Arduino programs. See the <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Pebble" target="_blank">HeatSync Labs Wiki article on the Pebble</a> for more info. <strong>Does not include LCD screen, sold separately below.</strong>

<h2>Pebble (Board Only): $5</h2>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1258" href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/img_20110129_025802_small/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1258" title="IMG_20110129_025802_small" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110129_025802_small.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="126" /></a>Just the circuit board for the Pebble, no components. See the <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Pebble" target="_blank">HeatSync Labs Wiki article on the Pebble</a> for more info including a Bill of Materials.<strong> </strong>

<h2>LCD (compatible with Pebble): $16</h2>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1260" href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/img_20110131_225509_small/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1260" title="IMG_20110131_225509_small" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110131_225509_small.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="84" /></a>This is a popular 2x16 parallel-driven LCD that plugs straight into the Pebble board.

<h2>Simon Kit: $30</h2>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-1259" href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/img_20110129_030451_small/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1259" title="IMG_20110129_030451_small" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110129_030451_small.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="139" /></a>Great kit for beginners to assemble and learn soldering, with all through-hole components (instead of tricky surface-mount stuff.) When you're done you get a playable "Simon Says" game that lights up and makes sound, plus the kit is actually an Arduino so you can buy a USB FTDI adapter and reprogram it using the Arduino program as if it were a "Lilypad Arduino w/ ATmega328."

<h2>USB FTDI Adapter: $20</h2>
<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1177" title="ftdi-small" src="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ftdi-small.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="188" />

Allows you to connect to an Arduino or similar microcontroller via USB, when the Arduino doesn't have its own USB port (i.e. the Simon kit and other Arduino clones.)

Requires a USB Mini-B cable not included.
