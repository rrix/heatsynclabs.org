Thank for you choosing to become a HeatSync Labs member! As we foster this community of learning, science, and the arts every member is important.

If you signed up for membership via PayPal -- your recurring monthly dues will be subtracted from your account the same date you enrolled.

If you chose Cash/Check -- you can either mail your dues (HeatSync Labs PO Box 24143 Tempe, AZ 85284) or deliver it to Jose Diaz (jose @ heatsynclabs.org) at HeatSync. Please note recurring payments are -highly- encouraged-- remember we do not have staff. If cash/check are important please consider prepaying for 3,6 or 12 months up front.

To claim any member benefits such as storage, grab a board member during your next stop into HeatSync. Please note 24/7 key access may require community approval and as such may not be immediately available.

Thank you for supporting our outreach efforts and helping us build financial stability in our new bigger and better 24/7 location.
