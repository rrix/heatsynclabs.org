**HSL Meeting (Thurs Jun 30) 7:00 pm|az @ HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall**

Miranda Heard and our own Will Bradley will be hosting a hands-on presentation on how to change the flavor of things to make them taste either really great or horrible.  We will have lemons, limes, and oranges but feel free to bring goat cheese and graham crackers to create key lime pie, strawberries, balsamic vinegar, grapefruit, coffee, tea, and any other sweet/sour things which Arizona-produced [mberries](http://mberry.us/) will remove the sourness from!

Also, we'll be making liquid nitrogen fruit jello -- that's jello inside the fruit it tastes like!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
