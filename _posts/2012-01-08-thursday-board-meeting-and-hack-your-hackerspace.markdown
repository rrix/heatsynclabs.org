This Thursday is our quarterly board meeting. The board will be discussing a number of topics outlined on this [scheduled agenda](http://groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs/browse_thread/thread/dc5dc7872a6c055a). All members in good standing are encouraged to attend the meeting and voice opinions on the topics that matter. We will be starting promptly at 7:00 PM in the common area downstairs.

Afterwards, we'll be holding our bi-monthly hackerspace hacking session! We'll have a list of tasks to accomplish for Great Justice, as well as a chance for the membership to steer the direction our space is headed.
