**Learn to Knit (<del></del>**<del>****</del>******Saturday, March 5th, 1pm****) @ HeatSync Labs - $30 [[Buy](../store/classes)]**

Knitting is a time-honored tradition of DIY with a history that reaches back to when DIY was the only way to go.  With knitting, yarn and sticks become coasters, scarves, clothing, and art. You too can learn the basics in this class.  Learn to begin (cast on), knit, purl, and end (bind off) as a beginner.  If you already know some knitting, we can go beyond the basics.  You will leave this class ready to make something of your own choosing.

_You take home_: **N****eedles, yarn, and whatever you make during the class!**
