**Dialogue with Solido (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Aux Conference Room ( at the rear of the building)**

Continuing our streak of 3D printing excitement, a few folks from [Solido](http://www.solidousa.com) will be visiting us to open a dialogue on the present and future state of 3D printing, and basically ask the rest of the 3D printing community what its up to.  If that community includes you, or if you just have an interest in 3D printing, this is definitely something you won't want to miss out on, especially since they will also be providing food for the event;  For free, even!

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
