I just added two new pages to the site.  "Completed Projects" and "Works in Progress".  We thought it would be a good idea to include a space on the site for members to post their projects up for everyone to see.  I put two projects I worked on in the past, as well as a project I am currently working on.  I also updated our hackerspaces.org [page](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/HeatSync_Labs) to include the URL of our site so people will be able to find us.  Let's keep this ball rolling!
