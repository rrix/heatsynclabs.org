Danny, from Downtown Mesa's very own [Rusted Nail Gallery](http://therustednailgallery.blogspot.com/) will be giving an overview of the art of resin casting. Whether you are looking for a way to create that little doo-dad for your next project, or a full sized replica of Bre Pettis's head, resin making provides an interesting solution to your problems, and Danny will be giving an overview of the mold making and casting process.

Resin casting provides hobbyists with an easy and cheap solution for model making, compared to large-scale solutions like injection molding. Stop by this Thursday at 7:00 pm to learn the art of mold making from one of our local artists!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.
