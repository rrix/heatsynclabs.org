That's right girls and boys, our fundraiser LAN Party now includes some fabulous prizes (thanks to [NXTGEN Networks](http://www.nxtgennetworks.com/)) for the providers of the most pwnage, like these:

In addition, we'll have a decent assortment of four xbox 360 games to give away as door prizes, and with a 30-person limit on registration, your chances of winning are quite good.   In addition, there will still be pizza and soda pop galore!

We also have some [fliers you can download and print to spread the news [PDF]](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HSL-LAN-Party-Flier.pdf), so feel free to put them on public places that are made for posting fliers and not police stations or seeing-eye dogs.

Cool peeps + pizza + soda + prizes + pwnage = lose your friend's cousin's boring wedding invitation and come to Chandler instead!  [Register today to reserve your seat](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/lan-party/).
