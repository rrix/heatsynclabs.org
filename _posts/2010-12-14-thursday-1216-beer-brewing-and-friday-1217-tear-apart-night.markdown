**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Join us this Thursday night to learn about making tasty, DIY beer.  Just like during prohibition!  Ben Conner from the [Arizona Society of Homebrewers](http://club.azhomebrewers.org/) (ASH), will be presenting on how to make your own beer and make it tasty and not fail.

**Tear Down Night (Fri) 7:00 pm|az @****** **Gangplank - Commons Area**

Our  special feature event where one of our home viewers dumpster dives and  finds amazing treasures and you all bring screwdrivers and hammers and  descend upon the pile, Lord of Flies style.   In the end we and learn  to live and love again.
