**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and   Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your   feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll   have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate   with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software  preloaded.

***** BONUS *****

This week's Arduino night will feature Todd, who will be presenting on hacking a Christmas-themed photo frame and adding even more holiday cheer to it with LEDs and Arduino!  Stop by to see how.

Don't forget: Wednesday nights are also our 3D printing night.  Stop by if making things in plastic using open source hardware is relevant to your interest!

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

This Thursday, we'll be presenting on finding potential ways in which digital applications can be intertwined with fabric construction and production.  If DIY fabric... fabrication is something you'd like to learn more about, this is your chance to.

Don't forget: Thursday nights are also when our solar working group, HelioSync, meets up and schemes ways of harnessing the sun's energy, McGuyver-style.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;    Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to   give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make:   magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our   Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
