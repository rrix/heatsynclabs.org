Gangplank's food drive to help Arizona's hungry was a spectacular success last year, and this year we'd like to help Gangplank continue that momentum again in 2010.  If you're stopping by Gangplank before Thanksgiving (such as for our [3D printing/RepRap meetup](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/)), please consider dropping off a can of [noms](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/om-nom-nom-nom) for those among us in need.  Precariously bulging drop-off boxes are located near Gangplank's Arizona Avenue entrance.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
