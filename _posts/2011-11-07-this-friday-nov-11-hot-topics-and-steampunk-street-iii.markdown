******Hot Topics - Lightning talks!**

Hot Topics is our unfortunately named lightning talks series modeled on events like Ignite, Ted, and [Noisebridge's Five Minutes of Fame](http://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Five_Minutes_of_Fame). Talks are <5 minutes and generally revolve around creation and hackerspace culture.

Tentatively Scheduled:



	
  * Jacob Rosenthal - Introductions Photo Tour of Hackerspaces

	
  * Justin Benore - [Anodized Screen Printing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=KOm-dmwaMBc)

	
  * Chad Stearns - [The Mathematics of Musical Harmony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=Sd6d0mrdUKQ)

	
  * Willow Bl00 School Factory, [Space Federation]( http://schoolfactory.org/content/space-federation-overview) [and Game Save (pre recorded at 1:02:00)](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/14824882)
