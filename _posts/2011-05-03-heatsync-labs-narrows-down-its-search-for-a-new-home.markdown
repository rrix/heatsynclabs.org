The Location Search committee is working on a shortlist of locations and draft leases for each.  After many visits to many spectacular spaces in great communities and intense debate on the merits of each, we've narrowed down our search to a few spaces in Tempe and Mesa.  Lease negotiations and talks with cities have delayed a vote of the Board of Directors at the April meeting.  The committee, however, will not present a promise it can't keep and it will ensure that everything a location has to offer is backed by provisions in a written lease before a Board vote is made.  This is an important decision, and as such, legal contracts must be looked over carefully.

Assuming there aren't too many more delays, the Board will vote on the committee's recommended location at the next Board meeting on May 12th.  As always, our board meetings will be open to all members to chime in with their thoughts.
