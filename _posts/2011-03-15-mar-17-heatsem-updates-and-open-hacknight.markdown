**HSL Meeting (Thurs Mar 17) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

The SEM crew are pushing hard on their efforts to create a DIY electron microscope, and they need your help.  Flanges need to be bought, stuff needs to be machined, materials need to be acquired.  Jasper will give us the latest scoop on the newest project to rock the lab.  If homebrew electronic microscopes aren't your thing, we will also be hosting an open hacknight in the lab for you to work on whatever project tickles your fancy.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**; Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs! If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
