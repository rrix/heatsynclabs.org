It's official: HeatSync Labs will be joining in on the explosion of inventive madness* that is Maker Faire in San Mateo this year, not only as mere observers, but as super-official mooches exhibitors, with a table and chairs and everything!  There will be other hacker spaces representin' too, and we totally want to collaborate on some group shenanigans.  This will be the 5th annual Bay Area Maker Faire, which will take place on May 22nd and the 23rd this year, so make sure to add that to your iCal, Evolution, Google Calendar, or whatever the kids use these days.  A number of HeatSync Labs kin are interested in attending, and if you are among them, post a shout out on our [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs) if you'd like to join us in our trip.
