Yes, for those of you who consult a calendar on a regular basis, you may have noticed that there is a fifth Thursday in October. (Seriously, I call shenanigans, but iCal proves me wrong).

The next meeting is October 29th, in our usual place. This is 2 days before Halloween - which is the ultimate maker's holiday.

So -- Back by popular demand, to answer all the questions you probably DIDN'T have...

**FAQ**
