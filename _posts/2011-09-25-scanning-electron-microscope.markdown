Those not at the lab until 3am might not be aware of the awesomeness taking place, so check out what's been happening with the community SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) project, fearlessly led by [Jasper Nance](http://twitter.com/nebarnix)! Progress on obtaining a vacuum is steady, after which we'll need to generate, focus, and scan an electron beam (just like a CRT screen).

Help has been in short supply for the electronics side, however, which will consist of reading the analog voltages coming from the sensors and interpreting them as images. If you have FPGA or other electronics experience, please step up to help one of the first affordable homemade/opensource SEMs come to life! Physical proximity to Arizona not required!

On with the updates! Last week we held a [Hot Topics](http://www.youtube.com/heatsynclabs) night where Jasper provided an update... other talks from that night are at the [HeatSync Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/heatsynclabs) page as well:



And here's a quick photo essay of the progress so far, from the community fundraising to buy the vacuum chamber and pump, to some awesome machining and welding work done both in and outside the lab, to the most recent vacuum results:
