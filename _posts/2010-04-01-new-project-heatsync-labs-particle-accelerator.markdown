The recent success of CERN's Hadron particle collision experiments have prompted the curiosity of many scientifically-inclined locals to wonder what it would take to build our own particle accelerator, without the Franco-Helvetican aftertaste, that is.  Using some information from Your Humble Editor's Toorcamp friends, we heard word of an underground decommissioned ICBM complex near the Arizona border in New Mexico and purchased the land from the owner who was more than ready to be rid of it, since it attracted tweakers and [duck-related graffiti](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattw/3695047605/).  The facility is completely self-sustaining, containing its own hydroelectric dam, toxic waste treatment facilities, and even an extensive underground tram system.

Late last year, a special task force was assigned to a secret mission at a Colorado thrift store where they rescued a vintage box from hipsters that wanted to use it for their clover cigars.  The box, you see, once belonged to none other than Nikola Tesla and features a hidden compartment containing long-lost notes with instructions for the construction of an anti-mass spectrometer which we believe we may be able to develop into an Arduino shield that could be used in the new facility.  With this, we will be able to create small-scale resonance cascades to study collisions of matter and anti-matter and finally get some goram flying cars!

Due to some non-disclosure agreements we signed, we cannot disclose our source of funding.  Anyone wishing to be involved in this project must sign a non-disclosure agreement and liability waiver.  While near some of the more anti-mattery equipment, an Hazardous Environmental Suit (developed at the [Crash Space Hackerspace](http://blog.crashspace.org/) to survive the environment of Los Angeles) will need to be worn at all times.  Parking stickers will also be required for any vehicles entering the premises.

In spirit of the region's environment, we have named the new space "Black Mesa Research Facility."  An unclassified partner in this venture will also be none other than MIT, who will be sending us a promising  grad student, Gordon Freeman, who is expected to receive his doctorate in Theoretical  Physics this June.  We look forward to having him join the ranks of HeatSync Labs and I'm sure we'll put his education to good use!
