**(Tue Dec 20) 7:00 pm|az @ HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall**

This Tuesday Cindy Ornstein, Director of the Mesa Department of Arts and Culture, will join us to talk about all the amazing resources available at the Mesa Arts Center. Available classes range from steel making and bladesmithing to glass working and firing! She'll also be talking about the upcoming Creativity Festival HeatSync will be participating in next spring. Robert Bell and Jacob Rosenthal have been tapped to organize Heatsync's involvement and several working groups have already begun meeting to talk about Arduino-fied interactive installations, a touch based water interface, analog and digital architectural projection, and more. Help us work on these, or get your own project spotlighted at this festival!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**; Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs! If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
