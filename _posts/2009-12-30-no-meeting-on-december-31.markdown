There will not be a meeting this Thursday, due to everyone being busy drinking champagne* and partying like its 2009.  Our next meeting will take place on January 14th, 2010, same bat time, at Gangplank in Chandler.  Happy New Years!

* Remember kids**, no drinking and driving!  Its a serious problem here in the MC and if you do it you'll be sent to Tent City--and I'm not talking about Toorcamp!

** By kids I mean adults over the age of 21 who probably act like kids when they drink.
