HeatSync Labs will have a table at the [Phoenix First Friday](http://phoenix.about.com/cs/enter/a/firstfriday.htm) art walk in CenPho this Friday, April 2nd in collaboration with [urbanSTEW](http://urbanstew.org/)'s Interactive Art Showcase for [Fringe Festival](http://phxfringe.org/), which kicks off on the same day.  A couple of us will be in full lab coat and goggle attire at 6:30pm bearing a color cube, projector, fliers, and some mysterious items for sale.  Our table will be right outside the 1005 Gallery on the corner of 1st St. and Roosevelt.  Stop by and say hi!
