More than six months ago, the HeatSync Labs community rallied together to raise funds for our very own laser cutter. After raising OVER 9000 dollars from our community and friends we ordered a laser cutter from China and began waiting. And waiting.Â Our champion Jeremy entered combat against the forces of US Customs and the FDA, who foolishly thought we'd use the laser for <del>etching body parts</del> medical purposes and sent it through the portal to [The Inspection Nether](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/The_Nether). 

It was a battle of epic proportions with much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Jeremy emerged victorious months later, holding a shipping invoice in his hands. And we had our very own laser cutter.

Congratulations go to the community who made this possible, including every one who donated to the fund, and everyone who put in their sweat, blood and time to make it happen.

However, the community still has much work to do before the cutter is operational and completely installed in the space.So, come on down to HeatSync Labs, check out our new toy and find out how you can help push this project to its final stage: AWESOME CUTTING THING OF AWESOME. We have electrical systems that need to be built out, documentation to write, and a laser to prime, calibrate and test. Whether you are a member or not, stop by any time during our normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 7-10pm, so stop by and lend a hand!

And remember kids, it's **not** a toy.
