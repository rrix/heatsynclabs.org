We're inching closer and closer to victory on our RepRap 3D printer.  Earlier this month, we completed assembling virtually all circuitry, although there were some setbacks and some ICs have to be reseated.  The X carriage components are also [nearing completion](http://twitpic.com/12z9zd).  We've also worked on the RepRap on off-meeting days when our Board members happened to show up on a whim.  If you'd like to join us on our sporadic adventures at Gangplank, keep a close eye on us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/heatsynclabs).

At our meeting this week, we plan to continue constructing the X axis, the extruder, and begin the construction of the Y axis components.   We also need to reseat the aforementioned ICs (**WANTED**: heat gun).  To keep track of the status of our progress in between meetings, check out the project's [wiki page](http://heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Phoenix_RepRap).

Meeting starts at 7pm at Gangplank on February 18th and runs until the last person leaves.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)
