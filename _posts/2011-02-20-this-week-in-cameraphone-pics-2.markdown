From left to right, top to bottom:



	
  * Jasper and the rest of the SEM project crew successfully create a vacuum chamber, MacGuyver-style!

	
  * Puppy, Jason, and Zach.P join up for an impromptu round of table-top gaming.

	
  * Our membership continues to grow, and so we immortalize their names for eternity in the lab for all to see, using [magnets](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fcking-magnets-how-do-they-work).

	
  * Joyce, Will, and Ashley.M team up to create a felt version of [the Old One](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/cthulhu.htm), with a dapper top hat for a night out in R'lyeh's fashion district.

	
  * Jasper kickstarts HeatSync Labs's initiative to create an [open-source scanning electron microscope](http://wiki.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/SEM_Microscopy), and gets the crowd exciting by looking at THE GRID a SIM card with an optical microscope.

	
  * With a broken Reprap and Fakerbot, our now internet-famous Schuyler saves the day by bringing in his Makerbot to explain to newcomers how 3D printing works.
