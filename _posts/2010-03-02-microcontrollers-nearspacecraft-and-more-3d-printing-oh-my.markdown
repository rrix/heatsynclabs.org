We're kicking off this month with a psuedo-marathon of awesome featuring microcontroller programming, RepRap construction, and our plans to purge the Harkonnen from Arrakis take some pretty pictures from spaaaaace!  Cancel your spring break bikini shopping and hop over to Gangplank this week and check out these fine events:

**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Conference Room**

Love Italian engineering but aren't hardcore/suicidal enough to drive a Vespa anywhere near Phoenix?  Learn Arduino instead!  Whether you're just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are a closeted PIC controller programmer, you'll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded (for real this time).

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Over the past month, we've sawed, hammered, and soldered away at the Phoenix RepRap to the point where it now spits out black plastic that looks looks like a plate of spaghetti from an Olive Garden in [R'lyeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R'lyeh).  We're hoping to get it to the point where it can print something more elaborate, though.  If you want to help us get there, join us!

Aside from our plastic printing shenanigans, our brave astronautical engineers in SyncFleet have been gathering materials, know how, and funds for our [nearspace balloon project](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Nearspace_Balloon).  If defying both gravity and [Californian imperialism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgS98Hnqlg) tickle your fancy, join us and make Arizona proud or something.  So say we all!

**BONUS:** This meeting will start off with a presentation on the basics of lock picking by Scorche, who's done this sort of thing at Defcon and other events, so if you're pick-curious, come on down!

At both events, we'll have t-shirts for sale and subscription forms for Make magazine available if you prefer not to do it [online](https://readerservices.makezine.com/MK/subnew.aspx?PC=MK&PK=2900068&FC=UNITED+STATES).  You can also give us cash just for the lulz if you'd like!
