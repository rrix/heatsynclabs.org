**ChipKIT Q&A (Thurs Jun 9) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Our friendly neighbors at Microchip have been working on bringing 32-bit microcontrolelrs to the Arduino crows.  Join us this Thursday for a special Q&A session on their new ChipKIT microcontrollers.  **BONUS**: They're bringing pizza!

**Update**: Microchip wasn't able to make it out tonight, but they plan on rescheduling to another time.  Stay tuned for updates!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
