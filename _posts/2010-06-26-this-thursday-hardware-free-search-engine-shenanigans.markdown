**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

HeatSync Labs is a group for people with multifaceted interests beyond simply electronics and touches on everything from origami to space travel.  Somewhere in between that range are open source web applications that troll internet superpowers for [Great Justice](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/11/2925299.htm).  One of these, the [Haystack Project](http://www.heatsynclabs.org), happens to have been created by a local HeatSync Labs member and was recently presented at the [2010 ACM Computers, Freedom, and Privacy Conference](http://www.cfp2010.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) in San Jose, California earlier in June.  This week, you'll be able to see that presentation delivered in Chandler, Arizona.

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
