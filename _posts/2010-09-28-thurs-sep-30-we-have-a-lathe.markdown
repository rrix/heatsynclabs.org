**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank -** HeatSync Labs HQ****

Thanks to a generous donation from newly minted HeatSync Labs member Corey and [Taig Tools](http://www.taigtools.com/), we now have a fully functioning [lathe](http://www.taigtools.com/mlathe.html) in our lab!  Join us this Thursday to learn all about how it works and how to make cool things with it.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for free;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
