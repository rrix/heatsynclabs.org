**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Nearspace balloons are great for AZ/CA hackerspace catfights, but did you know they can be used for SCIENCE as well?Â  Jasper did this with the University of Idaho in Soviet Moscow, and will tell us all about how our Idahoan friends accomplished exactly what we plan to do: Send a balloon into space and take pics because it will happen!

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine  subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of  Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona  Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
