Cool stuff happens in the lab all the time.  To help document proof of cool stuff happening in the lab, we now have a [borrowed] Nikon D5000 equipped with an EyeFi card you can use at your pleasure to automatically upload photos to our [hslphotosync Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/60827818@N07/)! Photos taken will be attributed to HeatSync Labs to be manually curated, labeled, tagged, and licensed under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license.  The camera is located on the lab bookshelf near the <del>Guardians of Hades</del> weird singing dolls.  Try it out, if you want to.  If you don't like Nikon and want to use your own camera, [join our Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/heatsynclabs/) and contribute photos online!
