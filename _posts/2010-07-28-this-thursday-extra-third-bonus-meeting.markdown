**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

There's no presentation scheduled for this extra Thursday, but we figured we'd open shop for anyone wanting to work on their own project, officially making this our [Anything Can Happen Thursday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unMO--eRXPg). Â Stop by if you want to work on, show off, or start a project!

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
