Just got back from my Chicago trip.  We visited the wonderful people at "Pumping Station: One" and got to see their version of an active HackerSpace.  It was awesome!  They were really inviting and gave us a whole bunch of great ideas that we can apply to our own future HackerSpace.  For more information about "Pumping Station: One" you should check out their site at:

You can see they're involved in a lot of projects at the moment and have established a great community in just a short time.  This trip got me pumped to push forward with our group.

I hope to travel to more HackerSpaces around the world as we continue to develop our own community.  One of the best ways to get started on something is to learn from those that already have.  Expect more "Travel" posts in the future.
