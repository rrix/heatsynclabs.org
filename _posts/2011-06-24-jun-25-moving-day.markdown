**Moving Day! (Saturday, June 25th, 10am****) @ HeatSync Labs at Gangplank**

Many hours of hard work have been invested by our volunteers to help fix up and paint the former Glitter Box into the home of the largest hackerspace in the American southwest.  We still have much work to do, and this Saturday we'll be finishing our move from Chandler to Mesa, the city where HeatSync Labs first held its meetings at the F.O.P. Lodge in 2009.  We have a truck/trailer on loan for us to use for the move, but we need people to move stuff on and off of it and into the new space.  If you have a truck yourself, please bring it along and we'll be sure to put it to good use.

Once we've completed the move, future events will take place in Mesa starting Monday, June 27th.  Our grand opening will take place in early July once we actually have furniture for people to sit on.  [Become a member today](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/memberships/) to make that happen faster!
