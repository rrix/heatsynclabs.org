Now that we're a fancy official nonprofit as recognized by the State of Arizona, we are taking the next step in putting together a fancy official Board of Directors to govern HeatSync Labs fancifully, with fancy Macs.   If you'd like to be on the first board of Arizona's first hackerspace, we are taking nominations for each of the positions, which are:



	
  * Champion(s)

	
  * Treasurer

	
  * Marketing Cheerleader

	
  * Editor

	
  * Secretary

	
  * IT Director(s)


If this sort of unpaid volunteer glory is appealing to you and you have a Mac, check out [our wiki](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Board_Members) and nominate yourself.
