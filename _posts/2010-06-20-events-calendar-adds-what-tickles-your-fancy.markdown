HeatSync Labs is making much use of Gangplank's space to bring you a new lineup of meetups and hacknights for you to work on projects and discuss the field of interest a project pertains to.  These include:



	
  * Augmented Humanity (Cybernetics/Prosthetics)

	
  * RepRap (3D Printing)

	
  * SyncFleet (The Final Frontier)

	
  * Arduino (Well, ok, you already knew that one)


All these and more events are now available for your viewing pleasure on our [events page](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/).  Check them out!
