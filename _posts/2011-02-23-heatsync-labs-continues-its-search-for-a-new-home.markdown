The Location Search Committee has kicked its efforts up to 88 miles per hour this month in the search for a new space to call our own.  We have met with city officials, community organizers, and property owners who share a vision with us.  All across the valley, from Mesa Drive to Grand Ave, we have received an incredible amount of support from people who love what we do.

The downtown Phoenix community has [put together a pledge to financially support HeatSync Labs](http://phxdowntowner.org/2011/02/14/heatsync-labs/), should it move to downtown Phoenix.  As of February 17th, the total number of dollars pledged has exceeded $1700!

The [iMesa UserVoice](http://imesa.mesaaz.gov/forums/97091-general) was [taken by storm](http://blogs.evtrib.com/nerdvana/2011/02/04/heatsync/) as people demanded that HeatSync Labs move to downtown Mesa.  This prompted the City of Mesa to visit the lab and set up tours of promising spaces in the downtown Mesa area.

Not to be left out, the [Mill Avenue District UserVoice](http://tellus.millavenue.com/forums/8158-general) also joined Mesa in having HeatSync Labs at the top of its most voted issue.  The City of Tempe is currently assisting in the search for a location in downtown Tempe, assisting with zoning issues.

Throughout March, the Committee will continue its search for the best location for future, long-term growth and sustainability.  At the moment, none of the target cities have been excluded from our search, and we'll continue prospecting for spaces in each until we find the best match for our needs.
