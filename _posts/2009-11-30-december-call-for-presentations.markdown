We're looking for presentations for our December 3rd and 17th meetings.  Zach.G and David.H will each be presenting on the 3rd on their separate adventures in Portland at the Super Computing 2009 conference and Dorkbot PDX meeting, but we'd like to see more presentations added to the mix.  If you have a tech/craft related conference you'd like to show-and-tell, or just have a cool project you'd like to show off, drop a line to jacob{at}heatsynclabs.com or uberschnitzel{at}heatsynclabs.org.

Both of December's meetings will take place at the [F.O.P. Lodge in Mesa](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1452+E.+Main+St.%2C+Mesa%2C+AZ) at 8:00 pm|az.
