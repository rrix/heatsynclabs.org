We're conducting a survey to help us get a better idea what sort of budget we'll be working with when we hunt around for potential spaces.  In order to do this, we need to find out what you can realistically afford every month, and what you expect to see funds used towards.  The survey is short, won't ask for identifying information, and will help us a lot, so please take a couple of minutes to [fill it out](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDJfVXVnblVOcWxKNU1GTUsyVDFLUnc6MA).
