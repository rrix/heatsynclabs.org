Hope you've registered if you're interested in learning to solder, code and hack with Mitch this Saturday! His Arduino for Total Newbies class is officially filled up! If you're registered, this post serves as a reminder to be there, though you probably did not need it! Be sure to arrive before 1:00 PM on Saturday so that we have time to set up and get ready for the class.

Just because the class is full, it doesn't mean that you can't show up though, and hack on something! Mitch will be hanging out before and after if you'd like to just hang out and chat, or show off the cool project you've been working on! We will also be working on a special secret HeatSync video project, as well! So stop by, whether you're soldering, storyboarding, hacking or any other awesome things you can come up with!
