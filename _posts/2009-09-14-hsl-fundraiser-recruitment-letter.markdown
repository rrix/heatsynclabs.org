Dearest HeatSync-ers!

The time has come to begin preparations for our very first fundraiser!  Sean, Rick and Jeremy have put the final touches on the Official Paperwork and it will be turned in shorty, allowing HSL to become a real non-profit!!!  That said, we want to be ready to hit the ground with a fundraiser so that we can get some money to MAKE STUFF HAPPEN!

I have offered to head this event, and I am asking for your help!  Please look over the following:

**The Facts:**
Event Title: _**HeatSync Labs Presents: "Poker Night (and Other Nefarious Deeds)" **_
Date: 3 October 2009
Time: 6-10 pm
Location: Mesa FOP (where we usually meet)
Goal: to raise $500 for HSL General Fund
****

The Vision: "Poker Night (aOND)" will be a step into the past.  From the password-guarded door, to the smokey lighting and the music, it will be an atmosphere of a prohibition-era speakeasy, complete with mob bosses and other underground characters.  There will be something for everyone: card tables at different levels of experience, black and white movies, a table to learn how to count cards, "Lock-picking with Jeremy the Shim" and other nefarious tasks.  Basically, I want to set up an environment that is fun and decadent, but also keeps in mind the Hacker essence while bringing in the bucks.  Costumes will be highly encouraged, but not mandatory.

**Interested???** Poker Night will be a pretty simple fundraiser to organize, easily do-able within a 3 week time frame as long as we have great volunteers!  If this sounds like something you want to make happen (and it should- this is the most important thing we can do to get HSL up and running), there is a task for everyone with every skill set and time available.
**
What I need:**
1. Some people to head up sub committees (Ex: Donations, activities, food, advertising). This is gong to be a bi-weekly commitment for meetings, some email communication time, and             the time required to do your appointed task).  Most intensive.
2. Some people to help the people heading the sub committees, This will be a bi-weekly commitment for meetings and as needed by the sub-committee head.
3. Some people who can help set up the day of the event (1 day commitment).
4. Some people to run events: Card dealers, food table/bar person, money collectors. (a few hours during the event)
4. Some people who can help clean up after the event (a few hours commitment).  Least intensive.

**What you need to do**:
1.[Email me](mailto:sierra@heatsynclabs.org) ASAP with how much time you have, what you'd like to do and if you have any special resources to donate/lend. (ex: roulette table, decorations, cards ect)
2. Start Brainstorming ideas!! As soon as you're on board, I'll share my more detailed document on how we're going to pull off the awesomeness.
3. COME TO OUR PREPARATORY MEETING!  We will meet this T**hursday (17 September) at the FOP around 9:00** (after the meeting is over/spud guns are started).  There I hope to             meet all of you and get the awesomeness underways!

Hope to hear from you all soon- this is an event that SHOULD NOT BE MISSED
