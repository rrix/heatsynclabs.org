HeatSync Labs meetings will once again take place on the first and third Thursdays of the month, after negotiating a plan to return to our original schedule, starting February.Â   This will help accommodate the [Arizona .NET User Group](http://azdnug.wordpress.com/) into meeting at their old schedule (which is our current schedule), and free up the second Thursday of the month to check out the [Phoenix Linux User Group](http://plug.phoenix.az.us/) meeting in Mesa.

**We will still have a meeting this coming Thursday night at our regular time** on January 28th, but we'll be meeting in Gangplank's conference room, located to the right of the entrance.  The Arizona .NET User Group will be meeting in the commons area that we normally meet in, just for this next meeting.  Feel free to bring in any cool hardware projects you'd like to show off!
