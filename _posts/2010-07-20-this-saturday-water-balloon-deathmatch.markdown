**HSL Water Balloon DEATHMATCH (Sat, July 24th) 5:00 pm|az @ Folley Park**

In a continuing mission to explore strange new fundraisers, HeatSync Labs will be holding an experimental team-based water balloon deathmatch game devised by the twisted mind of Your Humble Editor this Saturday at Frye Park in Chandler.  Bring balloons and water guns and we'll sell the water for them.  PROTIP: Also bring sunblock, drinking water, a hat, mosquito repellent, some basic knowledge of physics, cash for balloons and water weapon refills, and clothes you don't mind getting soaked or chalky.  Stop by and burn some cash and calories with us!

**PRICE**: $5 per 20 balloons

Folley Park is located on the northwest corner of Frye Road and Hamilton Street at:
[ 601 E Frye Rd
