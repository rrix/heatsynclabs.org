Bilal Ghalib, the author of the [Two Hands Project](http://www.twohandsproject.com/),  isn't going to be able to make it to Phoenix.  Due to this change of plans we will be meeting at our usual time next week, Thursday 9/17/09 at 8:00 PM.  We have also restructured our meeting routine to move the boring incorporation stuff prior to the actual meeting.  At 7:30, one half hour before the meeting's scheduled time, we will be discussing the progress of incorporation and other business related stuff.  Everyone is more than welcome to attend if they feel the need.  This should open up a lot more time for the fun stuff.
