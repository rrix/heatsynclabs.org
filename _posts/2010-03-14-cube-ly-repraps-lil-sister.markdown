**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

As we've been wrapping up the construction of our RepRep Mendel 3D  printer, other variations of the RepRap design have been discussed.   Some variations can even put [frosting on  cupcakes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattw/3695939368/).  A newer design has been put together with the aim of making the build process quick and cheap.  Dave from the [Cube.ly project](http://cube.ly/) will be presenting on this design, the Cubely Seabiscuit model, and its differences and advantages over the RepRap Mendel model HeatSync Labs is creating and Makerbot's Cupcake CNC.

As always, t-shirts and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our mafioso Board of Directors.
