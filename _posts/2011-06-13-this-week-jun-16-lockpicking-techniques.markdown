**HSL Meeting (Thurs Jun 16) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Join Austin Appel aka Scorche and the HSL crew for an overview of lockpicking techniques.  Topic covered will be internals and operation of basic locking mechanisms, how to exploit unavoidable imperfections present in the manufacture of these devices, and other related topics to serve as an introduction to this field.  After the presentation, we will host a hands-on lockpicking village.  There, visitors can practice picking locks in a hands-on setting and learn about many of the locks that are used to secure their home and business. Visitors are encouraged to bring any locks that they want to learn more about, either how to open them, disassemble them, or just learn what features they might have.  Tools will be provided if you do not already own a set.  If you have picks, be sure to bring them.  Have a padlock/safe you need opened?  Bring that too.  If you have any unused padlocks/locks/knobsets/etc, donations are accepted to be used in further workshops!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
