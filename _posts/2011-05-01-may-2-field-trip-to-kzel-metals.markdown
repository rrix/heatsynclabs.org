**Arduino Night (Wed May 4) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**K-Zell Metals Tour (Thurs May 5) 7:00 pm|az @ K-Zell Metals**

HeatSync Labs is taking a tour of [K-Zell metals](http://www.kzell.com/) in Phoenix this Thursday.  K-Zell has a wide range of awesome tools for metal working available, [including a 4000 Watt (yes, 4000) laser](http://www.kzell.com/capabilities.php#laser).  If metal working is relevant to your interests and you'd like to see how the pros do it, don't miss out!

**IMPORTANT**: Bring toe-covering shoes (mandatory) and don't be late, tour starts at 7:15pm!
