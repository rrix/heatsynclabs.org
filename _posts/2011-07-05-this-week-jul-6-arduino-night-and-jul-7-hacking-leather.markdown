**Arduino Night (Wed Jul 6) 7:00 pm|az @** HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall****

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs Jul 7) 7:00 pm|az @ HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall**

Join us for a overview of leather working with Bry, a professional member of the Tandy Leather Factory in Tempe.  If you've ever been interested in creating your own leather handiworks and crafts, we'll be going over the basics in preparation for a hands-on workshop in the near future.  Stay tuned!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
