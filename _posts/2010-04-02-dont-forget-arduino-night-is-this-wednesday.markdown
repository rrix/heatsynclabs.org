**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Conference Room**

Lots of cool stuff comes from Italy, like Nutella!  Arduino is also from Italy and unlike Nutella, Arduino won't make you fat or give you [diabeetus](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/diabeetus)!  Whether you’re  just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are a closeted PIC  controller programmer, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of  Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with  the Arduino software preloaded.  _A presto!_

As always, t-shirts and Make: magazine subscriptions will be  available and hustled aggressively by our mafioso Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona  Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)
