**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

As it turns out, the Gregorian calendar puts our next meeting on the first of April, also known as April Fool's Day.  We're still having a meeting, though, with more nearspace and reprap action for all.  As with any meeting, feel free to bring in your own projects and work on them with us.

As always, t-shirts and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our mafioso Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)

You just lost the game.
