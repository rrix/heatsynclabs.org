In the coming weeks, we'll be changing up the format of the HeatSync Labs website to include a blog to show off local maker talent, in a similar format to the [Make Blog](http://blog.makezine.com/).Â  If you're making (or better yet, have already made) anything cool or interesting, or know someone who is, let me know at huertanix{at}heatsynclabs.org so we can publish it to the site and make you internet-famous!
