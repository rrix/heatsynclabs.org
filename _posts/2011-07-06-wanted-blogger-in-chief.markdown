As part of our recent restructuring of the HeatSync administration to include an operations team, we're now looking for a skilled writer to take command of the heatsynclabs.org blog, which gets mad linkage and will associate your writing with an organization known all over the Phoenix valley area and beyond.  If you think you have what it takes to consistently update the World Wide Web with the latest scoop on HeatSync news and interview local makers on their projects in a way that captivates your audience and doesn't bore them, we want you!

If you're interested, please contact board at heatsynclabs.org and send links to samples of your writing.  This is a volunteer position, the only payment we can offer is in <del>bitcoin</del> internet famousness and semi-journalistic experience.
