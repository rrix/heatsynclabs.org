**HSL Meeting (Thurs May 19) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

While a lot of the HeatSync Labs crew will be trotting around California for Maker Faire, Will Bradley will be hosting this week's meeting with a second night of Kimono lantern soldering while screening _Arduino: The Documentary_ at the same time!  Come continue our efforts to help [Tokyo Hackerspace](http://www.tokyohackerspace.org/) help Japan!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
