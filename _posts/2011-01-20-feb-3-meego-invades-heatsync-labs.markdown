**Intel AppUp Application Lab (Thurs) 5:30 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

[MeeGo](http://www.meego.com/), [the Fungi from Yoggoth](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mi-go) successor of Maemo and Moblin, is a collaborative effort between Intel and Nokia to create an open-source platform for a myriad of mobile devices.  Intel is invading HeatSync Labs + Gangplank to show you how to be pro at development on them.  There will be foods to nom and peeps to meet, but **you need to [register online](http://ce1.com/intel/2011/azappuplab/) ahead of time** to make sure you have someplace to sit.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;     Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to    give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make:    magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by  our   Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
