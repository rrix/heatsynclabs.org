**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

There's no shortage of people at HeatSync Labs who love coffee.  For the longest time, HSL board meetings were even held in a coffee shop in Tempe.  In recent years, Arizona has become home a more than a few quality local roasters who put special attention to detail in the scientific processes that create great coffee.  Ron Cortez from [Cortez Coffee Company](http://www.cafecortez.com/) will be presenting on those details and will answer questions on the science behind the bean.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
