Do you have fond memories of stepping on LEGO bricks and all the cool stuff you could build with them?  Luckily, LEGO is still around and hasn't been totally replaced with Pokemons and Bratz dolls in modern-day childhood.  You know what else hasn't changed?  Texas Hold 'Em!  Join Gangplank's [FIRST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST) [Lego League](http://gangplankhq.com/2010/08/dedication/) and HeatSync Labs on September 16th for a night of grown-up merriment in support of the kiddies and their engineering ambitions.

Admission is $40 cash, which will buy you chips to play.  Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 4rd place winners.  [Register online](http://www.pingg.com/public_event/mqjqy5jezbhxkn6dj) to attend.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
