**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

HeatSync Labs has a fun new toy that was recently donated to us.  It uses the power of vacuums with space-age plastic materials to create a wide variety of stuff.  Unlike our open-source-age RepRap though, this actually works molds things around other physical things rather than printing them out layer by layer in ABS.  If this sounds like something you'd like to get your hands* on, stop on by and bring something you'd like to make a copy of!**

As always, t-shirts and Make: magazine subscriptions will be  available and hustled aggressively by our mafioso Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona  Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)

* Don't actually put your hands or any other appendages on the machine, it can melt you like butter.

** Don't put pets in the machine, it can melt them like butter.
