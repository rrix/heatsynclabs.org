**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Whatever table we commandeer**

HeatSync Labs's new pad in downtown Chandler may currently look like the inside of a Jawa sandcrawler, but that doesn't mean we won't break the new place in with Arduino night this Wednesday.  Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are a closeted PIC controller programmer, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

***** New address! *****
