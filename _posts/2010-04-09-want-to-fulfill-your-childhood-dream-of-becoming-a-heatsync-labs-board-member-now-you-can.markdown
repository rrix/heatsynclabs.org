Hey everyone, as you might have noticed on our [Board page](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/contact/board/), we currently have two positions that have been vacant since their previous officials resigned.  As required in our [bylaws](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Bylaws), the officers of the Board must elect some replacements to fill the positions until the next general election.

We're asking for nominations for candidates for the office of Treasurer and Resource Manager.  The descriptions of what responsibilities these offices entail can be found in the [bylaws](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Bylaws).  All board officers must pay monthly dues, attend bi-weekly Board meetings, and are encouraged to walk around in lab coats.  If you're interested in joining our ranks, please e-mail Jacob and Jeremy using info {at} heatsynclabs.org.
