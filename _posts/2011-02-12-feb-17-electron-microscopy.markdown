**HSL Meeting (Thurs Feb 17) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Our very own [Jasper Nance](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/) and [Brandon Guida](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brandon-guida/17/403/935) will be talking all about microscopes, but not your every day science project microscopes.  Nay, they will be discussing serious business science electron microscopes, like the ones used by NASA to inspect meteorites!  Will it be possible to bring one to HeatSync Labs?  Stop by and find out!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;   Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to  give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make:  magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our  Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
