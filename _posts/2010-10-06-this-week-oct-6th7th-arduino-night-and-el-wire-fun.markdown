**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank -** HeatSync Labs HQ****

Our very own Co-Champion, Jeremy has been dabbling in the world of electro-luminescent (EL) wire, which is sort of like spaghetti, but with a higher voltage and not as tasty.  If you're interested in making things glow with (literally) more flexibility than using LEDs, stop on by!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
