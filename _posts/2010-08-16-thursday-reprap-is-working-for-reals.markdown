**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

After several long months of sneaking plastic out of UAT, soldering and desoldering boards, and swapping out more parts than Swedish plastic surgeons, our brave team of renegade engineers has created the first working RepRap Mendel printer in the Phoenix valley area.  It can print [whistles](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1046), [trendy hipster glasses](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:793), and [LEGO-esque blocks](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:591)!  Our very own [Jacob Rosenthal](https://twitter.com/jacobrosenthal) will be there to show us the ropes and guide us through the open source home manufacturing revolution!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for free;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
