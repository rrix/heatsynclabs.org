**HeatSync Labs 2010 Election (Thurs, Nov 11) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Rear Meeting Room**

Election day is upon us.  After only one year since its inception, HeatSync Labs has become a household name in the Arizona hacker/maker/awesomeness community and a known name beyond state and national borders.  The board I serve with have done amazing, wonderful things that have exceeded the expectations of even our own lofty ambitions.  However, any organization that is not actively recruiting the successors of its leadership is an organization with an expiration date, and this is where we need your help.  If you share our vision for a new renaissance of cooperative creativity in technology and art in a premier organization, join us!

Nominations are now open for all [Board positions](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/contact/board/).  If interested, please e-mail board at heatsynclabs.org with your full name and what office you'd like to run for.  [Become a member](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/get-involved/membership/) and vote, run for office or just volunteer for an office of the Board.  Your time is energy is crucial to the success of HeatSync Labs.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
