HeatSync Labs is taking a step back to the 1980s this Thursday, July 21 and dragging out the Ataris, Intellivisions, Apple ][ and anything with 8 bits or less! Challenge the resident retro gaming masters at Ms. Pac Man, Frogger and countless other games that defined our youths while sharing yet another ascension story from the depths of the [Mazes of Menace](http://nethack.org).

Bring a friend, bring a system, bring a game and have a night of fun while reliving some of the memories of youth. We'll be playing everything from the Atari 2600 to the Apple ][gs, to the Intellivision and the Sinclair ZX80. As a special bonus, HeatSync Labs board member Will Bradley will be firing up the oscilloscope and taking on challengers at a game of [Tennis for Two](http://www.flickr.com/photos/60827818@N07/5941685811/in/photostream), one of the first video games ever created. What was once a large array of vacuum tubes is now condensed on to a single Arduino and will be available for play this Thursday!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money to help diffuse the costs of running programs like this and our new laser cutter, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and promoted by our fantastic volunteers.
