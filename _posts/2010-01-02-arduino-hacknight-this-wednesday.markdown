Arduino is an open source microcontroller system developed by [some guy from Italy](http://twitter.com/MBanzi), where Ferraris come from!  It provides a flexible and easy to use platform for creating a wide variety of interesting hardware projects (such as the Nikon remote pictured above) with little experience required in microcontroller programming.  Gangplank is hosting the event, and we'll be there too, representin' and such.  If this sounds interesting enough for a trip to Chandler, stop by Gangplank this Wednesday at 7:00 pm and check it out!
