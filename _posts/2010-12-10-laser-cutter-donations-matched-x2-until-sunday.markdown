*** **UPDATE**: With the addition of funds from an anonymous employee from [NXTGEN Networks](http://nxtgennetworks.com/), the total of funds available in matched contributions is now **$1000**!

We've recently crossed the $5K mark on our [Laser Cutter Kickstarter fundraiser](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heatsynclabs/laser-cutter-for-phoenix-area-makers), and we want to keep that momentum going all the way to the finish line!  [Jasper](https://twitter.com/nebarnix) and an anonymous [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com/) employee have combined their donations to generously  offer to double every pledge.  So... a $10 pledge becomes $20, a $50 pledge  becomes $100, etc, up to $500 in matched pledges, but only until **this Sunday**, 11:59pm Arizona time.  If you haven't donated yet or  you are thinking of increasing your pledge, now's the chance to double your donation's impact.  [Donate today](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heatsynclabs/laser-cutter-for-phoenix-area-makers)!
