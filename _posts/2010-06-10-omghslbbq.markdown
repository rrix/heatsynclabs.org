**HSL BBQ (Sat, June 19th) 1:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – South Parking Lot**
Join us for a preemptive Independence Day barbecue on Saturday, June 19th at Gangplank!  There will be some hot dogs, burgers, and other BBQ staples to set ablaze on the altar of noms.  A minimum $5 donation gives you access to tasty foods with fellow HeatSync Labs members and patrons.  [Download the flier](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hslbbq.pdf) and tell your friends!

_But wait, there's more!_

In addition to the barbeque, we'll be throwing down our musical skills in an impromptu jam session akin the last one that ended up in a song about the Rep Rap.  If you want to join us, bring the  instrument of your choice and join the cacophony!
