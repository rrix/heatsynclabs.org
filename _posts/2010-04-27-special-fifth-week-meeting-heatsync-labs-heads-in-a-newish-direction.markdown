**Special 5th Week HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

HeatSync Labs is holding a special meeting this Thursday to discuss our future direction and the location that we will call our home in the near future.  As good news spreads fast and you may have already heard, Gangplank is moving to a newer, bigger location in downtown Chandler, and we've been offered to come on down with them.  In addition, the City of Chandler's Innovations incubator is also looking for tenants while a similar offer has been offered to us in downtown Phoenix by DA Therrein, the artist behind the Beautiful Light installment that HeatSync Labs members helped build for the Nuit Blanche festival in Toronto last year (more on that story later).  More information on our options for a location are [now on the wiki.](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Location)

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona  Ave  at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)
