We'll be hosting our 3rd weekly public Meeting this Thursday at 8pm.  We'll presenting:

1.  Some of the locations we've found so far.
2.  Examples of locations that will not work.
3.  Call for Presentations

I heard a couple people were interested in doing impromptu presentations on random topics on Thursday. We'll also have our lock picking table set up and possibly a small activity with radios. Hope to see a bunch of new faces there!  We've got the whole lodge to ourselves this week and I hear there's cake.  Whooo!
