Thanks to everyone who came to the meeting tonight.  We had a lot of fun.  We are going to meet up at our usual meeting place this weekend on Sunday at 6:00 PM with our cannons.  From there we can caravan out to the desert or a park or something to launch potatoes into the stratosphere.  We will try to come up with a good launch site before we meet and post it up here.  Even if you didn't build one but you want to come along, feel free to stop by.  If you have another cannon you've built before, feel free to bring that along too.  The more the merrier!

We will not be providing projectiles (potatoes) or propellant (hairspray) so you will need to bring your own.  Make sure you buy potatoes that are a little bigger than the barrel of the spud guns.  You want them to fit snug with no gaps around the edges for maximum distance.  For propellant, you want to use some type of cheap flammable hairspray.  I've heard that Aquanet works well.  You may want to try to find something non-scented if you don't want to smell like an 80's hair metal rocker.

Questions?  Do you know a perfect launch site?  Leave them in the comments or email me at ricko@heatsynclabs.org .
