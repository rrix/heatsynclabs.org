The official HeatSync Labs T-Shirt is currently being mass-produced with the replicators we got from Starfleet in lieu of a 3D printer, and will totally be available at the next meeting, which will be at Gangplank in Chandler, and not Mesa.  What will these shirts look like, you ask?  Take a look:





{% include JB/setup %}
{% assign caption_text = "Keep it classy, Arizona" %}
{% assign caption_photo = "http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/heatsync.png" %}
{% include heatsynclabs/caption %}

Shirts will be available in various sizes, and each will sell for the low, low price of $20.
