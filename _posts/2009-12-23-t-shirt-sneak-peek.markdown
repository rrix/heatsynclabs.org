The official HeatSync Labs T-Shirt is currently being mass-produced with the replicators we got from Starfleet in lieu of a 3D printer, and will totally be available at the next meeting, which will be at Gangplank in Chandler, and not Mesa.  What will these shirts look like, you ask?  Take a look:

Shirts will be available in various sizes, and each will sell for the low, low price of $20.
