Heatsync Labs's website is sufficiently geek, but can it also be chic?  Heatsync Labs's board nominees will convene this Saturday, November 14th, 3:00 pm at Cartel Coffee Lab to find out.  If you're a creative type bursting with website ideas that won't make us look like a Geocities museum, you're invited to come along and share a perfectly-brewed latte with us and voice your thoughts on how to bring up heatsynclabs.org to web 2 point OVER 9000!
