We're sure to be busy for this Wednesday night's Arduino night. First, if you started your [Arduino with Mitch Altman](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/reminder-this-saturday-mitch-altman-will-be/) but didn't finish, tonight is a great night to stop by and finish up! Plus we've got the Mesa Arts Creativity Festival working group stopping by to arduino-fy an upcoming installation. And of course we'll be hosting all the usual Arduino hackers. Stop by, bring your project, and play with our toys.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
