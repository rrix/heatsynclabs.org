Hey Everyone!

Sierra mentioned this in a [previous post](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/?p=132), but we are hosting a Poker Night as a fundraiser for HeatSync!

Theme: Poker Night! And Other Nefarious Deeds...
Date: October 3, 2009
Time: 6-10 pm
Location: Mesa FOP Lodge 9 (per our usual meetings)
Tickets: Presale (available at 10/1 meeting) $10 pp and $12 couples, Door $12 pp and $18 couples.

Please contact Sierra or myself if you have poker chips or are willing to help set up for this event!
Costumes are encouraged, but not required. We are looking forward to seeing everyone's smiling faces as we commit dastardly deeds and have a wonderful time! Feel free to bring that special someone along with!

PS: One last thing - there will be alcohol available for purchase to guests who are 21 years or older. Please be responsible and safe! We can help arrange taxis or rides home - just let us know!
