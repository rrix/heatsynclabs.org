**UrbanSTEW Presents: January STEWshop (Jan 15th) @ MADCAP Theaters
**

Our friends at [UrbanSTEW](http://urbanstew.org/) are teaming up with us once again to host a pretty cool set of workshops on January 15th at [MADCAP Theaters](http://www.madcaptheaters.com/) in Tempe.  This month's workshops will focus on circuit board soldering and Arduino programming, so if you want to get good with an iron or learn Arduino's distinct flavor of C, stop on by!  Check out UrbanSTEW's [Stewshop itinerary](http://urbanstew.org/workshops/) for pricing and scheduling details.  These are the two workshops HeatSync Labs will be running:﻿

**Soldering and Assembling Your Own Arduino Shield ****(2:00pm - 3:30pm)**** - $40 [[Buy](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/145108)]**
Electronics are made of boards with components on top.  Ever wonder how those tiny components get soldered into a circuit board, or what sort layout they need to be in to work with Arduino?  Join us for a 1 and a half hour hands-on workshop where your friendly neighborhood hackers will guide you in soldering and assembling your own Pebble shield, an I/O expansion board for the Arduino microcontroller.

_Take home_: **Skills**, **Pebble board**
_Borrow or buy_: **Arduino**

**HeatSync Labs Presents: Introduction to Arduino and the Pebble (3:45pm - 4:45pm) - $20 [[Buy](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/145111)]**
Arduino is an open-source, open-ended platform for making lots of cool stuff with electronics.  The Pebble shield is an add-on for Arduino that gives it even more features, including light and temperature sensors, and a variety of extra inputs.  Join us for this 1 hour workshop and learn how to program an Arduino microcontroller to take advantage of these extra functions.  You can build your own pebble in the "Building Your Own Pebble I/O Shield" or just borrow one of ours.

_Take home_: **Skills**
_Borrow or buy/build_: **Arduino**, **Pebble board**
