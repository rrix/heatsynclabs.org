**HSL Meeting (Thurs Apr 21) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Kelley Gullo and the FIRST-affiliated South East Valley Engineering & Robotics E-initiative ([SEVERE](http://severerobotics.org/)) will be showing off their very own real robot that they built for this year's regional competition.  If you're interested in robotics, stop by to learn the gritty details on how it works.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
