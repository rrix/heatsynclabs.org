**Arduino Night (Wed Jun 1) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

*****BONUS*** **Our friends at Microchip have supplied us with a sweet stash of [chipKIT microcontrollers](http://hackaday.com/2011/05/21/bamf2011-chipkit-is-arduino-to-the-power-of-32/), which are 32-bit, Asuka-red, and mostly Arduino compatible!

**HSL Meeting (Thurs Jun 2) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

In one of the most marginalized community’s in the world, the Kenya Maasai Mara which lacks electricity, thousands of kids resort to lighting a fire at home to do their homework. The result is often eye damage due to smoke exposure and light strain. To advance education and create a brighter future for these special kids, join Megan Bednarz and HeatSync Labs as we discuss designing and building low-cost, portable solar-powered lanterns.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
