Well, sort of.  One of HeatSync Labs's founders, SyncFleet director, local maker, veteran Defcon goon, and overall chill dude [Rick Oooooo](http://twitter.com/rickoooooo) is moving to Eugene, Oregon.  There, he will re-unite with his lady and hopefully bring the hackerspace movement to a city which so far just brings up pictures of [cheerleaders and models on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/places//United+States/Oregon/Eugene).  Maybe he'll convince them to put down the pompoms for a bit and pick up a soldering iron!  In any case, Rick will be missed by all and Your Humble Editor will be jealous of his new forested home state.

_One more thing..._

We will have a board position opening up now that Rick will be in the Beaver State (lol).  The board is made up of hardcore mofos who work hard for free and have a passion for making HeatSync Labs as awesome as possible.  If this sounds like you, we want you in our ranks.  E-mail board at heatsynclabs.org with the subject line "Open Board Position" and let us know what l33t skillz you can bring to the table!
