HeatSync Labs would like to give a double thumbs up to everyone who took time off their busy schedules of playing Left4Dead and watching Lazy Town to assist us in our ambitious mission to make open source ABS plastic fabrication fun and sexy for the whole family.  We'd like to especially thank everyone that helped us break the Catch 44-esque requirement for printed plastic parts needed for the assembly of the RepRap.Â  Hats off to:

  * Karl from [Kzell Metals](http://www.kzell.com/)

We also appreciate our east coast allies that wanted to volunteer parts, but had their 3D printers or transport to 3D printers tragically frozen by the [snowpocalypse](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordansissel/4361550572/in/photostream/).
