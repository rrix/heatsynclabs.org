The Electronic music scene shares a lot in common with the hackerspace scene; people playing with and sharing circuits that do awesome things. After a live performance at our [One Year Anniversary Mustache Party](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/oct-23-mustaches-music-and-mad-science/), we are welcoming back [Thru the Wires](http://www.myspace.com/thruthewires) to HeatSync Labs for a presentation on the art of circuit bending and electronic music!

Whether you've dinked around with your own circuit bending patches, or you've never touched a synth in your life, Menagam and Dim will be showing off their art and how they made it this Thursday. Mengam writes:

random assortments of goodies, which will then manipulate video to the
tempo. The patch will be using max and jitter to create an audio/visual
image.


And Dim will be showing off how to use CMOS in your electronic music setups.

If you've ever had more than a passing fancy at doing your best Bit Shifter impression or just enjoy making loud scratching sounds, or even if you just want to sit back and learn how the pros do it, make sure you're at HeatSync Labs this Thursday at 7:00pm! If you're lucky there will even be some live demos by Dim and Menagam!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
