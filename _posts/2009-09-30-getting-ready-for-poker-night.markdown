Hey HeatSyncers,

We talked about getting set up last meeting and what tasks we need to do.  Here's the list, please feel free to take these actions on your own, or work within this forum to get organized.

1.  Buy your ticket early at this week's meeting: $10 per person or $12 per couple (buy a ticket for your friends and make them come too!)

2.  Take the [Donation Letter](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/w/images/2/2b/Fundraising_Letter.doc) to your favorite shops and stores and ask for support in the way of donations!  These will serve as prizes for our Poker games, because its more fun to play for something.  Any business will do: I've had luck in the past from large groceries, home improvement stores, hardware stores, restaurants and especially locally owned businesses.

3. Decoration Committee: be at the FOP (our usual meeting place) at 1 on Saturday to help with the decorating and set up.  This task is more fun and faster with more people.  I want to be done to let people go home and get ready if they want.

4. Food Committee: we need people to volunteer their time to make their special favorite appetizer/snack/dessert/finger food for the party. We had a couple of folks volunteer their kitchens so that it can be a group effort last week.  Please post your info if you want to help on the food front.  I'd like to have all the food ready to go at the FOP by 5.

5. If you have any of the following to donate or let us borrow, please let me know.  It would be great if you could bring them to Thursday's meeting!

-Poker chips

-Playing cards

-Old mobster movies

-Anything else that fits the theme

Thank you all for your support and help; we are going to have a rockin party and poker night.
