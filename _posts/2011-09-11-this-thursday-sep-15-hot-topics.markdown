**Hot Topics Presentations at HeatSync Labs**

Hey Arizona, what are you making? Whether it's an electron microscope or a human powered helicopter or browser-based games or any number of projects we have yet to hear about, the community is working on some awesome projects. This Thursday, HeatSync Labs is giving the community aplatform to show off those projects in our first Hot Topics night!

Named in honor of every one's favourite pseudo-goth shopping establishment, Hot Topics gives the community five minutes to get on a soapbox and talk about the awesome project they're working on. Whether you are looking to show off something that's already been done, or looking for a chance to get excited people interested in your next greatest idea, come by this Thursday at 7pm! If you are interested in presenting your project, please email ry@n.rix.si ahead of time so that we can do some scheduling.

**UPDATE:**

The first batch of talks is as such:



	
  * Ryan Rix, Introductions
