Makers, Hackers, Do-ers, Tinkerers and Breakers of the Valley unite! This Saturday, HeatSync Labs will be hosting the Hacker Pavillion at [Phoenix's Inaugural MakerFaire](http://www.makerfairephoenix.com/).


> Maker Faire is a newfangled fair that brings together science, art, craft and engineering plus music in a fun, energized, and exciting public forum. The aim is to inspire people of all ages to roll up their sleeves and become makers. This family-friendly event showcases the amazing work of all kinds of makers – anyone who is embracing the DIY spirit and wants to share their accomplishments with an appreciative audience.


We will be hosting a ton of awesome things in the pavillion, including Scorche's awesome Lockpicking village and Schuylar's Makerbot 3D printer along with the rest of our awesome Young Makers! Our good friends at [Local Motors](http://www.local-motors.com/) will also be on hand showing off the Rally Fighter and the plans for their next Open Source car!

The event promises to attract the Valley's best makers, so don't miss out! We'll also be hosting a supar seekrit MakerFaire After Party near the event, so make sure you come by and say Hi and get an invite!

Phoenix MakerFaire 2011 is located at [3rd Street and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=tl&q=roosevelt+at+3rd+st+in+phoenix+az&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=E+Roosevelt+St+%26+N+3rd+St,+Phoenix,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85004,+Estados+Unidos&gl=ph&vpsrc=0&view=map) and will be starting at 11:00 AM, ending at 7:00 PM.
