**Paint the Space! (Saturday, June 18th, 1pm****) @ HeatSync Labs (Mesa)**

Over the course of the week, we have steadily begun to transform the former Glitter Box space into a hackerspace.  At the moment, its still covered in various inconsistent shades of pink and pastel greens and purples.  We want to make the place a little more futurist-friendly, so to start that process off we'll be covering the painting some modernism into the space.  Join us for a day of painting, followed by more painting.

We'll be hustling for donations to get the space furnished after the paint dries, so if you haven't yet, [please donate now](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/memberships/) to make this happen.  With enough funds to get the place furnished, we should be able to schedule Monday, June 27th as our final move-out day.
