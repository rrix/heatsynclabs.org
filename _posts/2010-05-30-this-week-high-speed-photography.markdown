**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Conference Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night.  Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are a closeted PIC controller programmer, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

This week we'll be shooting things shooting other things, because YO DAWG, high-speed pictures of stuff being shot at is awesome.  Additionally, did you miss out on HeatSync Labs's invasion of Maker Faire and Noisebridge last weekend?  No worries, we'll be showing of photos from the adventure, but without any boring slideshow narration, for an immersive 2D experience you surely will not want to miss.

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.
