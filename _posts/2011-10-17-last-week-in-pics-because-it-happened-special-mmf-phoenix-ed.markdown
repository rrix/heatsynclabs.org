Our apologies for the late post! Last Saturday, HeatSync Labs hosted the Hacker Pavillion at the Valley's first Maker Faire, and we've been busy! But boy howdy, was it incredible! We also had the chance to see the Tesla Coil back in action in time for Second Friday thanks to the awesome work of Jasper and Prescott. There's action in the space nearly 24 hours a day, so be sure to check it out!
