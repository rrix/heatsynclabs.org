Jasper is back in action on the [SEM project](http://wiki.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/SEM_Microscopy)! She's recently posted two updates on the SEM buildblog:

_**[Compression Fitting Assembled with BA Gauge](http://hsl-sem.tumblr.com/post/14701732133)**_

> The BA gauge which I want to use to measure the ultimate vacuum level is a glass tube type and lacks a flange. The solution is either to torch a metal fitting out of kovar (expensive) or to use a simple viton O-ring compression fitting. Since the latter isn’t destructive and I don’t yet trust my glassblowing skills, I went with the compression fitting.

Instead of buying a compression fitting from a vacuum supplier, I decided to go ahead and turn one on the lathe for practice. The combination of threading, tight tolerances, dissimilar materials and knurling made this the most advanced lathe project I have yet taken on.

> The turbomolecular pump has been attached! The largest flange on the chamber is a KF-50 for various reasons including cost of fitting hardware. Above this size, ISO fittings must be used and these are much more expensive than the KF style.
