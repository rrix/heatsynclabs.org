:drum roll please:

As another step towards our ultimate goal of having our own 24/7 space is a move to a new location -- Gangplank HQ in Chandler, AZ.

Gangplank is a local technology startupÂ incubator with a great facility and wonderful community atmosphere. They have like-minded goals of education, community outreach and inclusion, and furthering technology in the Phoenix Metro area. Their usual operations including being open form 8-5pm M-F for businesses and individuals to come use their resources to conduct business. Wednesday nights they remain open for, what they call, Hacknight. We have been talking with their operations staff and they have welcomed us!

So starting in January, we will be meeting at Gangplank HQ.

Many of us have already been spending time at Gangplank, either on Wednesday nights or various other times. Its an awesome place, folks.

**Things to Note:
**Meetings will be the **second and fourth** Thursday of the month.
**First meeting of 2010 will be January 14, 2010. **
Gangplank has free Wifi (WOOHOO!!)
