**SyncFleet Launch (Sat) 5:00 am|az @ Gangplank - HeatSync Labs HQ**

SyncFleet is skipping Saturday morning cartoons this weekend and heading out to the desert to launch the Majel Barrett nearspacecraft that we've built to take pictures of the curvature of the earth from spaaaaaaace!  If you're involved in the project, please let SyncFleet know if you'll be coming and if you'll be bringing a vehicle in advance in our [Google group discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs/browse_thread/thread/6d8320f6f9f8c50).  We'll be meeting up at 5 AM in the crack of dawn **sharp**, so please make sure not to party too hard on Friday.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
