**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and    Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your    feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll    have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to  collaborate   with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino  software  preloaded.

**Intel AppUp Application Lab (Thurs) 5:30 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

As [mentioned previously](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/feb-3-meego-invades-heatsync-labs/), Intel is invading HeatSync Labs to tell us all about [MeeGo](http://meego.com/) and other platforms of interest.  All developers are encouraged to attend, but the lab will still be open for routine shenanigans for people that don't want to learn about cool platforms to write apps for.

***** NOTE: Seating is limited and you will not regret [registering](http://ce1.com/intel/2011/azappuplab/) beforehand.  *cough* _MeeGo Conference Dublin_ *cough* Trust us on this one. *****

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;      Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want  to    give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and  Make:    magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled  aggressively by  our   Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
