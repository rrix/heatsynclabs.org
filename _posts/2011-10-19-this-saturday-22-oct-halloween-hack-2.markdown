Come down to HeatSync this Saturday for our first Halloween Hack night! We'll be open tonight and all week with our tools and resources for you to start working on a kickass costume or prop. From knitting to sewing, from laser etching to lathing, to electronics and soldering, we will be at the Lab making awesome things.

This hack night also opens up our Halloween contest; either [Send us](http://www.youtube.com/user/heatsynclabs) a video showing off your completed work, or drop by on Halloween and our judges will pick their three favorites to win $5, $20 or $50 in gift cards! So let's get hacking, and make something awesome!
