**Arduino Night (Wed Aug 3) 7:00 pm|az @** HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall****

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**Tear Apart Night (Thurs Aug 4) 7:00 pm|az @ HeatSync Labs - Kipp Hall**

A lot of technologies are sold as boxes that do our magic for us, but what actually makes these devices tick?  Our recurring Tear Apart Nights help to demystify the inner workings of our technologies and get rid of the stigma behind voiding the warranty on things you own.  Regain ownership of your possessions!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership and sponsorship subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our volunteers.

HeatSync Labs is located east of Robson on Main Street at:
