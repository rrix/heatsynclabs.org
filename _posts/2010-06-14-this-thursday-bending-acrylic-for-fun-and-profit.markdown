**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Plastics, unlike flying cars and Jupiter space stations, actually did become the future.  This week, Bill Mar from [Special Computing](http://specialcomp.com/) will be showing us how to make clear acrylic bend to our will, literally.  You can make custom project encasements, modern furniture, and even a dock for your <strike>Nokia N900</strike> Motorola Droid as seen in the picture above.  Stop by and see how!

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)
