**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - West Parking Lot**

This week, local artist [Laurie Nessel](http://www.laurienessel.com/) will be presenting on the craft of glassworking, which she also presents on at the Mesa Center for the Arts.  Not only will she be talking about her skills, she'll be showing them off and shaping glass live and in real-time!

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.
