Joey Hudy, local 14 year old [maker of awesome](http://lookwhatjoeysmaking.blogspot.com/), was at the White House this week for the White House Science Fair. Joey's inventions and hacks have won him awards and sponsorships at the various maker faires and now even a trip to the White House. Congratulations Joey!
