Welcome to the 2010s!  HeatSync Labs is bringing in the new decade year with its first meeting at our new location at Gangplank in Chandler.  We've got big plans for this year, including filing for 501c3 status, building a RepRap printer, and everything in between.  Our new location features free wifi, plenty of table space, comfortable chairs, pirate flags, and the latest copy of the Linux Journal in each bathroom, holy kaw!

But wait, there's more!

We'll have complimentary pizza and drinks, just like an IEEE meeting, except we'll be discussing technology that we will build ourselves, with our own hands.  Specifically, we'll be discussing the RepRap printer project our benevolent Board of Directors has rescued from being mothballed into a box of broken dreams by lack of funding from ASU.  We're building it, and we want you to be part of it.  This meeting will be when the endeavor begins, and it will end when it can print parts to make itself.  Aside from this new flagship project, we encourage anyone working on anything interesting to bring in their projects and show them off too.

Meeting starts at 7pm on January 14th and runs until the last person leaves. Just a reminder: Meetings are now on the **second and fourth** Thursday of every month.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
