Last night's meeting:



	
  * After a a few hours of reading ridiculously long legal sentences and writing some of our own, we've finished our Arizona Articles of Incorporation.  Look for a copy of the paperwork on the wiki soon.

	
  * Sierra is putting together the details for an upcoming fundraiser; please [contact her](mailto:sierra@heatsynclabs.org?subject=Fundraiser) if you would like to volunteer.

	
  * Next week's meeting will include a build session for potato cannons!  Rick would like to get an idea of how many people are interested in building a spud gun of their own, the project cost should be less than $30.  [Please RSVP](mailto:ricko@heatsynclabs.org?subject=Spud Gun RSVP) no later than Wednesday so we can gather up the parts.  Check back for more details in the next few days.


If you haven't already noticed, we've opened registration on the blog so that everyone may contribute content.  You'll find the link on the right column of the page under Meta. Once you register you are allowed to create posts and submit them to the editors for review.  Please respect the privilege and add premium content.

We've also thrown up a wiki!  You can find that in the right column as well, under Internal Resources.  It should be a great place to keep project documentation and look for inspiration.  If you registered on the wiki when it
was still interfaced with the WP user database, you may need to request a password reset on the wiki.  That single sign on system was badly broken and I've reverted to the typical separate registration. Double check that your login still works for WP and respond to this post if there are any problems.
