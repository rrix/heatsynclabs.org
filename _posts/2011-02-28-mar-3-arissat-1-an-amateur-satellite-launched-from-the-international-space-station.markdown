**HSL Meeting (Thurs Mar 3) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Steven Bible from TAPR will be presenting on the ARISSat-1, an amateur microsatellite launched in January from the International Space Station--that is to say, from **space**!  The satellite will downlink live SSTV images from four on-board cameras as well as 24 greetings in 15 languages on the FM voice frequency 145.95 MHz. The BPSK-1000 sig downlinks as SSB on 145.920 MHz.  Telemetry and amateur radio call signs of those instrumental in amateur radio in space will be transmitted at 145.919 MHz. For the amateur radio operators there is a 16kHz wide transponder for two-way contacts. All of the transmissions and receivers use newly created software defined radio technology.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**; Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs! If you really want to   give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make:   magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our   Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
