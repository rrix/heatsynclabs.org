**HSL Meeting (Thurs, Oct 21) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank -** HeatSync Labs HQ****

In anticipation of Halloween, HeatSync Labs is having a craft party involving stuffed animals, stitched to parts of other stuffed animals, with electronics for guts to make it light up and make some noise!  If you've ever fantasized about what [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) would sell if it was bought out by [Umbrella Corporation](http://residentevil.wikia.com/Umbrella_Pharmaceutical,_Inc.), now's the chance to build and bring home your very own cuddly abomination of science and technology.  A limited supply of plush animals and electronic bits will be provided, but please bring as much of your own materials to trade and use.  Special thanks to [Circuit Monkey](http://www.circuitmonkey.com/?name=Home) for donating blinking LED eye sets.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
