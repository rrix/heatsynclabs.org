HeatSync Labs is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization which operates to fulfill its mission of facilitating and enabling people to build awesome things.  It is not a business and has no employees.  Unlike a business, a nonprofit positions itself to be where it would be needed, not where it'd made the biggest buck.  Mesa does not have a major university or semiconductor giant churning out or bringing in engineering talent and engineer salaries.  Even so, our organization has become a magnet for engineers and artists of every definition and has helped bring a strong technology community into an area where none previously existed.

HeatSync Labs is also a hackerspace, and unlike a large technology company or university, its doors are not restricted to people with the right test score or resume.  It aims to be accessible, but also needs to pay bills to keep its doors open.  The way we do this is partially by membership dues, but even with that revenue in hand, we still need to buy things like decent furniture, lighting, equipment, and pay for utilities.  If too much of the time and energy of our volunteers is siphoned towards raising funds instead of using it to make a great hackerspace, we fail.

People from across the world both have looked up to the rapid growth and growing list of accomplishments the HeatSync community have achieved.  To donate to HeatSync Labs is to invest in awesomeness.  If you've accomplished financial success you can spend $200 on a premium cable package and consume a fiction, or you can put it towards building a reality in a place that wants to reinvent it.
