**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

HeatSync Labs in downtown Chandler is where the switches at this week, with a presentation on some switch-building projects involving chunks of wood and conductive ink on cloth will be presented on by our very own Rick Oooooo and friends.  Anyone interested in learning about conductive ink or chunks of wood should definitely attend, as well as anyone that just wants to work on their own projects.

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.
