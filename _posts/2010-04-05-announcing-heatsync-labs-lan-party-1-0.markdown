Gaming? In my hackerspace?

**LAN Party! May 1st (Sat) Noon - Midnight @ Gangplank**

That's right kids, we're bringing in hellsummer with an epic day of pwange, pizza, and profiteering fund raising!  Admission is only $20/player, $10/casual observer, giving you access to our professionally setup LAN with our very own game servers and reserved seat.  Speaking of seats, there's only 30 of them, and they're expected to go fast, so [register now](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/lan-party/) and also help us choose what games to make servers for *cough* Star Trek: Elite Force 2 *cough*, and also who you want to sit next to.

But wait, there's more!

Your admission fee also pays for unlimited pizza and soda, like a buffet, but also with packet switching! Holy kaw!

PROTIP: There's a number of requirements our IT Directors are demanding and willing to enforce with the fury of OVER 9000 suns, so be sure to read them over when you [register](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/lan-party/).

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona  Ave  at:
[325 East Elliot Rd. Suite 34
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=325+East+Elliot+Rd.+Suite+34+Chandler,+AZ+85225&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.005754,59.414063&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=325+E+Elliot+Rd,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=h&z=16)
