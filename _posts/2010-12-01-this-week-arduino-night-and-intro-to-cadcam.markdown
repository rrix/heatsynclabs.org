**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and  Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your  feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll  have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate  with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Straight from the streets of London, the Beatles Jack Meyer from [H3-D](http://h3-d.com/), jewelry production technology specialists, will be joining us to discuss the use of CAD/CAM in the context of rapidly custom jewelry manufacturing.  Stop by for a primer on CAD/CAM tools and their various usefulness.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;   Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to  give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make:  magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our  Board of Directors.
