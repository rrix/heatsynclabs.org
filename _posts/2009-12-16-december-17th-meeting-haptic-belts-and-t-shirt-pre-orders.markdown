Our next meeting will feature a presentation from our very own Spartan-monarch-style-Champion, Jacob, who will discuss a vibrotactile (haptic) belt concept that he and his team at the ASU Center for Ubiquitous Computing have been developing for situations where visual and auditory means of communication may already be clogged up by other sensory input, like Lucha Libre.  A very basic example of this would be a cell phone's vibrate mode.

Unlike a mere cellphone though, this is a belt that can activate up to sixteen points of vibration and torture ticklish people and it will totally be demo'd, so you can see it in action or wear it!

T-Shirts are still being printed, but if you'd like to pay for one in advance, you can do so at the meeting and it will be ready, waiting, and longing for the touch of your skin at the next meeting.  They look really nice too, its not some ghetto Cafepress cruft.


This meeting will take place at the [F.O.P. Lodge in Mesa](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1452+E.+Main+St.%2C+Mesa%2C+AZ) at 8:00 pm|az.  A half-hour operational meeting will take place at 7:30pm|az at the same place and will cover the latest news on everything the Board is doing to push HSL forward if you'd like to be updated on such things.
