Welcome to September, kids!  This week we have our Arduino night and our Meeting night back-to-back!  Deets:

**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Whatever room we commandeer**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are [Massimo Banzi](http://twitter.com/mbanzi), you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Have you ever fantasized about being Wall-E and sifting through piles of electronic waste to find some useful component nuggets you might eventually need for some kind of project you haven't thought of yet?  Good news: We're recreating a post-apocalypctic landfill full of broken used electronics at Gangplank and welcome you to dig through the parts and maybe be a robot.  Bring your old electronic junk and be prepared to bring some back with you.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for free;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
