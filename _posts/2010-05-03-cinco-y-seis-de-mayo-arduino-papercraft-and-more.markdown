**Arduino Night (Wed) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Conference Room**

There's no better way to prep yourself for a wild, crazy night of playing a leaked Starcraft 2 beta Cinco De Mayo partying than by hacking on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew.  Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or are a closeted PIC controller programmer, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as some HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

This week we will have a guest from ASU, Dr. Goran Konjevod, who will be speaking on his [mathematically-intense paper craft](http://www.organicorigami.com/gallery/index.html).  If you have an interest in geometry, origami, and making two-dimensional surfaces three-dimensional, you won't want to miss out!  Other locals are also working with paper to make awesome things, and if you're among them, stop by and show us what you have.

**HSL at First Friday Artwalk (Fri) 6:30 pm|az @ Downtown Phoenix**

We're continuing our new tradition of having a presence at the Phoenix First Friday Artwalk again this month, and we're bringing along a weather balloon for mysterious shenanigans.  What kind of shenanigans?  Find the dudes and gals in lab coats this Friday to find out!

As always, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the southeast corner of Elliot and Arizona Ave at:
