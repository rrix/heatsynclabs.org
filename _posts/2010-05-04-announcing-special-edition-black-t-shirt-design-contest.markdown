That's right girls and boys, HeatSync Labs is announcing our first ever t-shirt design contest!  We've pre-ordered several black shirts with a very basic, boring design, and we'd like to solicit the fine citizens of cyberspace to add their own design to make it awesome!

The winner will get one of the shirts they designed in their preferred size, as well as a handful of half-inch HeatSync Labs pinback buttons to put on messenger bags and/or funny hats.


Plone rules!


**Da Rulez:**



	
  * Single color only (logo on the base design is around the neighborhood of #CCCCCC);  Can be any 1 color, even black if you enjoy losing

	
  * Design will be applied to front side only

	
  * Design must measure 11" x 17" at 300 DPI

	
  * The winning design will be applied on top of the existing one manually, so don't expect the design to be perfectly aligned most of the time

	
  * Design can be made with glittery ink like the lettering on "juicy" labeled shorts, if specified


Submissions must be sent to joycetang {at} heatsynclabs.org with the subject line "T-Shirt Contest" no later than May 11th, 2010.

***** Deadline Extended til' the end of May!  Submit Now! *****
