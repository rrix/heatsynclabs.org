**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

This week, our very own Will Bradley and Rob Coffman will be showing you how to recover data from  a hard drive.  With a screwdriver.  Yes, we will be taking apart a hard drive, like daredevils jumping over a pile of trucks on fire, but nerdier!  Stop by and void your warranties with us.

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
[260 South Arizona Ave
Chandler, AZ 85225](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=260+south+arizona+avenue+chandler+az&sll=33.30078,-111.840713&sspn=0.008035,0.010021&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&ll=33.299615,-111.841915&spn=0.008035,0.010021&z=16)
