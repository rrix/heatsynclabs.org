As you may have noticed, we're added a thermometer-looking thingy to the front page on our website, except it measures money.  We're getting started with a $5k fundraising goal, which will be used to help build a solid financial base for buying things like basic equipment or even a space for a month or two.




We realize that you may still have some holiday shopping to do, but why buy Uncle Willy an automated tie rack when you could instead help us establish a hackers space so you can BUILD him one next year?  Also, orphaned puppies and kittens are counting on you, so donate today!***


***** 2009.12.27: UPDATE: It works now, you can give us money again. :) *****

***** 2009.12.12: UPDATE: Our Google checkout account is currently failwhaling.  We are working with Google to resolve this. *****
