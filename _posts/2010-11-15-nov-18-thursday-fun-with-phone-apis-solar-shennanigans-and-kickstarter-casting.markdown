**HSL Meeting (Thurs) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Tonight, David and David are on-stage back-to-back with various things to tell you.  David U will be giving us an update on the [solar concentrator](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Solar_Concentrator) being built by [HelioSync](http://heliosync.tumblr.com/), HeatSync Labs's own solar energy working group.  Following that, David H will be talking about using the Twilio API, Ruby, Arduino, and Ikea food containers in a recipe for [truly epic lulz](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Dial-a-Lulz).

_But wait, there's more!_

This Thursday and Saturday night we'll be shooting a kickstarter video to convince the internet to buy us a laser cutter, and we want you to be part of this endeavor!  We need a cast of 8 people, with 4 non-speaking extras, 2 hosts, and 2 "special guests."  We also need:



	
  * Microphones (2)

	
  * Spotlights (Any amount)

	
  * A decent quality HD video camera if available


If you are interested in helping us get serious equipment in our lab or just want to become internet-famous, meet up with David H after the meeting!
