As some of you may know, Red Bull of North America has been delivering mysterious boxes to hackerspaces across the country, [including our east coast friends at Alpha One Labs](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/03/red-bull-got-hacked-by-alpha-one-labs.html).  Today, we got one too!  This <del>TRON LARP</del> Tuesday, join us as we open our mystery box, warm up our soldering irons, and build/hack/reverse engineer the riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  The box opens on **March 29th at 7pm**!  Bring your skills!
