**Both sessions are now sold out! Watch here soon within a couple weeks for more classes**

Austin Kipp will be teaching this Crash Course on Welding which will also certify you for use of our welding equipment. Each class will accommodate 3-5 people and last as long as 4 hours! The class will focus on MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding but will include grinding and related metal work to be successful in welding.

Learning to weld correctly involves a combination of instruction and practice. For each hour of instruction, the student needs to put in MANY hours of practice, the combination which is sometimes difficult to accommodate in our busy schedules. So, in an attempt to meet the needs of more people and make it more affordable and flexible, Austin will give the instruction and then you will do the necessary practicing on your own.

What you bring:

Non-synthetic clothing with long sleeves and long pants (jeans and a cotton long sleeve shirt work fine) plus sturdy, closed toe shoes.

What you leave with:

Box or frame (TBD) you welded!
