**Arduino Night (Wed Apr 6) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank – Rear Meeting Room**

Come by and hack on Arduino boards with the HeatSync Labs and Gangplank crew this Wednesday night. Whether you’re just getting your feet wet in microcontrollers or build your own Arduino shields, you’ll have the company of a wide skill range of Arduino hackers to collaborate with, as well as a few HSL laptops with the Arduino software preloaded.

**HSL Meeting (Thurs Apr 7) 7:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

Did you know food can be delicious?  It is, and it can be proven with science.  Shauna Stacy of Geek Girls fame will be presenting on experimental gastronomy.  Stop by to explore the scientific reasons of why food is tasty and understand categories of flavor with us.

**PROTIP**: We'll be using Miraculen to make sour things sweet. Bring random juices to hack flavor with!

All HeatSync Labs meetings are open to the public for **free**;  Cover charges are for Scottsdale night clubs!  If you really want to give us money though, t-shirts, membership subscriptions, and Make: magazine subscriptions will be available and hustled aggressively by our Board of Directors.

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
