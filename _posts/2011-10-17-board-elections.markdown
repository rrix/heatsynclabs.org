Another year, another chance to enact a coup d'etat and unseat your Fearless Leaders! This Thursday, HeatSync Labs will be holding its annual board elections. Members are invited to take part in [the mailing list thread for the election](http://groups.google.com/group/heatsynclabs/browse_thread/thread/da33ce666b569fd0) and be at our glorious space to vote! While we are membership driven, our board works towards meeting our Non-Profit goals as well as handling the dirty parts that no one actually likes, like paying bills and putting out literal and figurative fires. However, they also get to party with the likes of Downtown Mesa and the rest of the valley, working to make our space even more awesome.




Whether you want our space to become a group of crypto-anarchists, or a Respectable Non-Profit, or have even crazier dreams, make your voice heard and help steer this organisation in the direction you, our membership, want to see it go!
