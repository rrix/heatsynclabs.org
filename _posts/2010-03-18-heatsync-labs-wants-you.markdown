HeatSync Labs is made possible by the efforts of people committing a large, but rationed portion of time and energy to make stuff happen and make it awesome.  Since we're not retired industrialists with lots of time in our hands (yet), the growth of our to-do list has begun to outpace our rate of getting tasks completed.  Simply put: We want your help.

If you have mad skills, we want them!  We have tasks for everything from Ruby developers to workshop organizers and t-shirt models.  A [growing list of tasks](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Help_Wanted) has been organized in the wiki.  If you see something that tickles your fancy, recruit yourself by adding your name next to the task and a corresponding Board officer(s) will contact you to begin slaving working with you!
