![Kimono PCB Design](http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/KIMONO.png)**Craft for Japan (Sun May 15) 4:00 pm|az @ Gangplank - Commons Area**

The earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011 caused massive destruction to families, farmlands, and water sources. Survivors in shelters were left without clean clothing, private housing, drinkable water, or power. To help those affected, join HeatSync Labs and possibly some special guests from Tucson's ownÂ [Xerocraft](http://xerocraft.org/wiki/Main_Page) to solder kimono lanterns (designed by [Tokyo Hackerspace](http://www.tokyohackerspace.org/en/project/kimono-lantern-kit)) to provide light, knit scarves to provide warmth and fold cranes to provide hope. Donations will be accepted to defray the cost of supplies and shipping as well as additional relief efforts.

Send your friends to [craftforjapan.org](http://craftforjapan.org/) if they're interested in helping out and/or donating!

HeatSync Labs at Gangplank is located on the northwest corner of Frye and Arizona at:
